## Hello there 👋
I'm Ivyer Qu, a current Pomona College junior studying computer science and neuroscience. 
-  I’m currently researching the brain as a powerful computer through neuromorphic computing!
-  I’m interested in how we can leverage biological computing systems to drive innovation in advanced computing processes.
-  I’m looking for help with gradient propagation solutions/workarounds in recurrent spiking neural network processes. 
-  Reach me at miqj2022@mymail.pomona.edu!
